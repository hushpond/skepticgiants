# Lotte Giants fans protest in Jamsil as slump continues

Lotte Giants fans staged a protest outside Lotte World Tower in Jamsil, southern Seoul on Wednesday, calling on the company to invest in improving the Lotte Giants just days after the Busan club suffered the biggest loss in KBO history.
 
About 50 Lotte Giants fans paid for a truck to be parked outside Lotte World Tower and the Lotte Department Store in Jamsil, carrying a digital signboard that scrolled through a series of messages calling on Lotte Group Chairman Shin Dong-bin to invest in improving the club.
 
Slogans such as "Don't force Lotte fans to cheer for incompetent athletes" and "Lotte collapses in the middle of Lee Dae-ho's last dance" appeared on the screen throughout the day.

The protest comes just three days after the Giants on Sunday suffered the single worst loss in Korean baseball history, dropping a game against the Kia Tigers 23-0 at Sajik Baseball Stadium in Busan.
